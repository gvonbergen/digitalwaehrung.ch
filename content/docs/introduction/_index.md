**Why DigitalWaehrung.ch Exists**

Over the past few years, I've been accumulating knowledge and insights about digital currencies and in especially stablecoins. My motivation for creating this blog is to share my findings, experiences, and expert opinion with a wider audience. The main goal is to create a valuable resource that can serve as a reference point for education, awareness, and learning.

Here are some reasons why I created this side about digital currencies and stablecoins:

1. **Documentation of knowledge**: As I've been researching and learning about digital currencies, I wanted to ensure that my findings were properly documented and easily accessible. By creating a website, I can save time and effort in organizing my thoughts, research, and insights into a coherent and structured format.
2. **Education and awareness**: I believe that education is key to understanding the rapidly changing landscape of digital currencies and stablecoins. My blog aims to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the topics, including definitions, concepts, use cases, and applications.
3. **Community building**: By sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, I hope to foster a sense of community among enthusiasts, and professionals who are interested in digital currencies and stablecoins. This blog can serve as a platform for Q&A, and collaboration.
4. **Stability and credibility**: As a reliable source of information, this site will help establish credibility and trust with readers. By providing accurate and well-researched content, I aim to become a trusted resource for those seeking insights into digital currencies and stablecoins.

Whether you're an enthusiast, or professional looking for insights, I hope this blog will provide valuable information and support your learning journey.

**Who am I?**

My name is Gregor an I see myself as a renowned expert in the field of payments and digital assets, with a career spanning over two decades.

My professional journey began as a Scientific Assistant at the **Universit√§t Bern**, where I worked on several research projects. During this period, I held various roles, including project work for "corporate climate and its effects on burnout" where I processed and analyzed large data sets with SPSS, and provided administrative support of several seminars and courses within the department of Management and Entrepreneurship.

In 2008, I joined **Credit Suisse** in a management support function within the product management payments and later moved into a project lead function. Over the seven years I've lead various projects within the cards and payments space. I finalized this as Head of Payment Client Migration Switzerland. In this role, I was responsible for defining and implementing a service offering around ISO 20022 market activities during the payment migration Switzerland, and also supported clients with their cash management / payment solution needs. 

In 2017, I joined **Capco** as consultant. First I was responsible for stream lead for the KYC remediation of a specific client sub-group (10% of all accounts in scope) in a major KYC remediation project for a Swiss private bank, as well as Project Management Office Lead to facilitate planning, tracking, status reporting and risk/issue management. Additionally, I was the stream lead for the project rollout within ten international locations worldwide and over 1,000 Relationship Managers. Later I've changed to **GWP** and started during that time privately ("Defi-Summer") to dive into digital assets.

Since 2021 I'm no fully involved also professionally in all digital assets activities within **Capco** here in Switzerland and support our clients with the implementation of payments and digital assets initiatives either as project lead or special matter experts. At the moment I'm leading a digital assets projects which covers the coiexistence of central bank digital money (CBDCs) and bank/deposit money.
